Well, it took me a while to get back to life after a huge jet lag hit me badly. Surprisingly, it wasn't that hard when I went from here to San Francisco, but it was much harder to come back to Israel. 10 hour difference in time zones do the thing.

I'm back from 10 days business and pleasure trip to Bay Area - San Francisco, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Paulo Alto, Cupertino, Saratoga (AKA Silicon Valley), San Jose and Santa Cruz. Here is a classic postcard picture I took in San Francisco:

We spent 2 days in San Francisco just traveling for pleasure,  followed by 4 intensive days of [Velocity](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/) and [DevOpsDays](http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-mountainview/) conferences in Santa Clara. The former is expensive, very big, public, focused on Web Performance and Operations. The latter is small, private, focused of DevOps culture. 

The conferences were different, but both very good. The reason I go there was to learn more about DevOps culture from experience of real companies and people who do it in modern web industry. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Netflix and others.

Few points that I marked to myself and were repeated over and over again on number of different sessions which are important for a  company to be Agile/Lean:

1. **Make a focus** - Great companies do one product, but do it outstanding. They focus on their product whole holistic experience - how it looks, how it feels, how responsive is it, how reliable is it, how easy is it, how intuitive is it, how much time does it take to get an answer from customer support and etcâ€¦ They invest most of the time in robust and scalable infrastructure, in performance of the applications, in fixing bugs, optimizing and analyzing.
 
2. **Recruit professionals** - experienced, full-stack developers are expensive, but in long run they worth it. You can have a lot of developers with potential, but still they need a senior to show them the right path and explain how things work in real world.

3. **Logging & Monitoring** - more than half of the booths and sessions in conferences where about monitoring and measuring of applications in production. It's extremely important to invest in this area. The tools that where mentioned the most: [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/), [logstash](http://logstash.net/)/[Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/).

4. **Open source everything** - open sourcing your code is coming with great responsibility to support the community (pull request, issues), but it also teaches you how to write good application -  tests, documentation, generic code, etc.. If you do it right, you will get help back from community. Open sourcing is social  programming.

5. **Bootcamps** - workshops, lectures. It's a common practice. Do it more to train your people and get them involved.

6. **Microsoft** - Windows, .NET world is a dead end. It's hardly  scalable (MS SQL Server), slower (IIS), harder to operate, complicated automation, requires stronger hardware and more.

We are definitely going to work on all of these in eToro. 


Few videos from the conferences which I liked and inspired me the most:
