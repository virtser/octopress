I just wanted to tell you about a very cool and groundbreaking test automation UI which was developed by [Maxim Guienis](https://twitter.com/maximguenis), my friend from eToro. It was designed for specific eToro needs to provide an easy "wizard like" tool for QA to write automatic UI tests.

It is called **APPLENIUM** ([APPium](http://appium.io/) + [seLENIUM](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)) and it uses Appium and Selenium frameworks as helpers to make mobile and web testing easy.

Find the [source code](https://github.com/bobmarthin/Applenium) or get more information about it on his [blog](http://applenium.blogspot.com).
