This is a very first post in my new minimalistic geek blog based on [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) framework for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging. 

It is supposed to be simple and easy to maintain. It supports markdown writing only, has no Admin UI and you have to commit changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/virtser/octopress) in order to publish a new post. Lets see how it goes.

I used to have sveral blogs in the past. One was a photography blog based on Wordpress, another photo blog in [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) and the last one based on BlogEngine.Net was my personal blog. 

All blogs I used to have, but photo blog, were in *Russian* only. It is my first attempt to write a blog in *English*. It supposed to server all my *English*, *Russian* and *Hebrew* speaking fruends.


I have to stop talking to myself as nobody read first blog posts...  
If you still read this, let me know in comments. ;)
