This is a very first post in my new minimalistic geek blog based on [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) framework for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging. 

It is supposed to be simple and easy to maintain. It supports markdown writing only, has no Admin UI and you have to commit changes to GitHub in order to publish a new post. Lets see how it goes.

I have to stop talking to myself as nobody read first blog posts...  
If you still read this, let me know in comments. ;)
