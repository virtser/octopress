Few months ago we started to get the vibes of change.

I think all started when [eToro] hosted it's first private [Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). All the company activities where paralyzed for 48 hours in favor of the Hack. Everyone could join the effort from HR to R&D. It was an amazing experience, when ideas of people who never had a chance to make a change and create something for our customers where chosen and brought to live.

Followed by our visit to [Wix](http://www.wix.com/), a successful Israeli company which does Continues Delivery (CD) and host millions of custom websites. At [Wix](http://www.wix.com/) we met [Aviran Mordo](http://www.aviransplace.com), a Back-end Group Manager, who gave us a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/aviranwix/scaling-up-to-30-m-users) about the switch to CD that they did and answered a lot of our questions. 

After this visit we realized that we can't continue the same way we did until now and we need to think how to get to CD. A DevOps forum was established by our management, a forum of 5 key people from each department in R&D and I was one of them. It's mission was to map our  problems in current development process and suggest a plan how to implement CD in the company.
