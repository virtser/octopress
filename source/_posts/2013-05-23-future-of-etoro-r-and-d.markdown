Few months ago we started to get the vibes of change.

I think all started when [eToro] hosted it's first private [Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). All the company activities where paralyzed for 48 hours in favor of the Hack. Everyone could join the effort from HR to R&D. It was an amazing experience, when ideas of people who never had a chance to make a change and create something for our customers where chosen and brought to live.

We started thinking and talking about [flat organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization) structure, how do we implement and encourage developers mobility in teams. A new term "Develorship" was introduces, which is talking about that any independent developer can lead projects. 

Followed by our visit to [Wix](http://www.wix.com/), a successful Israeli company which does [Continues Delivery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) and host millions of custom websites. At [Wix](http://www.wix.com/) we met [Aviran Mordo](http://www.aviransplace.com), a Back-end Group Manager, who gave us a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/aviranwix/scaling-up-to-30-m-users) about the switch to Continues Delivery that they did and answered a lot of our questions. 

After the visit we started to read and think about Continues Delivery and [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps). How do we optimize our process? How do we make non blocking development? How do we automate everything that can be automated? How do we stop wasting our time on working with interfaces? And more questions that should be answeredâ€¦ We realized that we can't continue the same way we did until now and we need to think how to get to Continues Delivery. 

To answer these questions, a DevOps forum was established by our management, a forum of 5 key people from each department in R&D. I was one of them. It's mission was to map our problems in current development process and suggest a plan how to implement Continues Delivery in the company.
