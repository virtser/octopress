It's all started, at least for me, about 6 years ago (at 2008). We were very few developers in a fresh new startup company.
And as any typical Israeli startup company of these years our focus was to build and deliver our products as fast as possible.

There were about 5 developers when each was responsible to cover products in multiple fields. As web developer I was responsible
to build and maintain company websites, Affiliates system and Billing front end. In the first year the development process was
almost unmanaged. We got requirements and requests for features development by email or on a short meeting. We had no revision
control system, neither bug tracking system. And it all worked fine, as soon as we were a small team.
