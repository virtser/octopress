With this post I'm starting a series of DevOps related posts. What is it, the past, the present and the future of DevOps in eToro R&D.

Lets start with basics, then drill down and expand to more details.

##What is DevOps?##

A formal definition taken from Wikipedia[^footnote]:

> DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals. DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. It aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services.

I personally don't really like such "dry" definitions.


Find below my short DevOps high-level presentation that I created and presented internally for eToro R&D employees last week:
