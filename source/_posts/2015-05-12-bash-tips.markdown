I wanted to share few Linux bash (terminal) tips I found to be useful for me over the last year.

#1. Commands
**cd -** goes back to previous directory you have been at. useful when you accidentally switch to root dir for example.<br/>
**!!** - repeats your last command. most useful if you forgot to add sudo to last command: sudo !!<br/>
**fuser -k tcp/8080** - to find and kill a process which is using port 8080.<br/>
**history**  - shows you the history of commands you executed)<br/>
**history | grep 'git'**  - will show you all the history items with word 'git' in it

And now try **Ctrl-R** in terminal to open history search and type the desired search pattern.

I'm sure you know that **Ctrl-C** cancels a process execution. Did you also know that **Ctrl-Z** pauses a process by putting it in background and releasing a prompt for you? To bring back the paused process type **fg** (ForeGround).

#2. Aliases
You can also set some aliases for your most used commands in **~/.bashrc** file:

My aliases are:

**alias ll='ls -alF'<br/>
alias la='ls -A'<br/>
alias l='ls -CF'<br/>
alias cd..="cd .."<br/>
alias node='nodejs'<br/>
alias s='http-server -o -cors'**

#3. Prompt 
As well as define custom prompt colors and git branch you are working on, like I have for example:
