Sometimes in eToro we are doing really innovative and beautiful things.

In our [Openbook] web application most of the calls are executed on client side using Ajax. Which means that our pages content is  changing dynamically. Google bots can index static content pages only.

It was a challenge to find a good and easy to implement solution which required minimum of changes on [Openbook] itslef.

Find below the presentation explaining our solution:

All the credits for the presentation goes to Omry Hay, for design to [Gal Segal](http://gal-segal.net) & Shlomi Shemesh and for implementation to Shomi Shemesh, the one and only!
