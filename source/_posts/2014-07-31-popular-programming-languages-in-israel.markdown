Some interesting numbers based on my LinkedIn research I did related to  choosing startup technology stack considering current situation on local market.

To get the data I just used Linked search and gave programming language name as keyword and filtered the results by location. 

Hope you find it interesting and useful for you.

Do you think LinkedIn reflect the reality? Let me know what you think.
