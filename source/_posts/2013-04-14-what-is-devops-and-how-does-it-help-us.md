With this post I'm starting a series of DevOps related posts. What is it, the past, the present and the future of DevOps in eToro R&D.

Lets start with basics, then drill down and expand to more details.

##What is DevOps?##

A formal definition taken from Wikipedia[^footnote]:

> DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals. DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. It aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services.

I'm not going to write here much again about DevOps as I you can just find below my short DevOps high-level presentation that I created and presented internally for eToro R&D employees last week:
