With this post I'm starting a series of DevOps related posts. What is it, the past, the present and the future of DevOps in [eToro] R&D.

Lets start with basics and then drill down and expand to more details.

##What is DevOps?##

A formal definition taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps):

> DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals. DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. It aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services.

Although it is a fine but "dry" definition, I like the more simple one found in [this](http://www.slideshare.net/geekle/devops-5348895) presentation online:

> **D**ev**O**ps is an approach to bridge the gap between agile software **D**evelopment and **O**perations (IT).

I'm not going to write here anymore about DevOps as you can just find below my short DevOps high-level presentation that I wrote and presented internally for [eToro] R&D employees last week:

Hope you could understand from this presentation what is DevOps in general and what does it suppose to give us after implementation. 

We have a very long way until it's going to be implemented, but we are on the right path. 

In the next post I'm going to describe in more details about [eToro] past and how everything has started.

Keep on reading and as always, I will be glad to get your feedback. ;)
