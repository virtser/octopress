I want to recommend you a book that I just finished reading â€” [Extreme
Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win](http://amzn.to/2ieEdUf).

If you are leading some field, a manager or want to be a manager, you
must read it.

Ownership examples taken from navy seals trainings which can be easily applied
to real life challenges in any company. Combining true battle stories and
practical implementations.

**Highly recommended!**
