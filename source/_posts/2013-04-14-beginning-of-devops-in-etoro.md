With this post I'm starting a series of DevOps related posts. The past, the present and the future of DevOps in eToro R&D.

##The Past##
Unfortunately we didn't invest enough or not at all in our past in anything related to DevOps in eToro for about first 5 years. As a typical startup we didn't have enough time  (netiher understanding) to think about our own scalability as an organization.
