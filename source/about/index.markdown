I was born in *Moscow* (Russia) at 1977. When I was 15 years old my parents decided that their children must have a brightet feature and a better place to live in. That's how I moved to *Tel-Aviv* (Israel). I'm maried and have two wonderful boys that keep me busy. ;-)

I work over 5 years in [eToro](http://etoro.com) as R&D teams manager, web developer at my past. We are building the worlds largest social investment network called [Openbook](http://openbook.etoro.com) which helps people to smartly invest their money. 

I'm an enthusiast photographer. I have started my photography hobby about 10 years ago. I shoot mostly landscape and street photography. You can find my photos at [500px](http://500px.com/virtser) or on my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/poison-dv/) page.
