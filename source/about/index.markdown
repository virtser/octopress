Currently working at [Spectory](http://www.spectory.com/en) as software engineering team lead on a very interesting project for Google. The challenge there is to form a new team from scratch and build a new strategic product.

Before that I worked at [eToro](http://etoro.com) as Infrastructure group leader, trying to hack the growth of eToro R&D with my team, optimize it, make it faster, make it scalable, work in DevOps culture. I used to manage number of R&D teams and was web developer at my past. 

I'm an enthusiast photographer. I have started my photography hobby about 10 years ago. I shoot mostly landscape and street photography. You can find my photos at [500px](http://500px.com/virtser) or on my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/poison-dv/) page. 

I'm a tech junkie. Actively following Twitter, reading RSS feeds on daily basis, love to play with new toys, install new apps, hack different stuff and post about it. 

I'm married and have two wonderful boys that keep me busy. Currently live in *Tel-Aviv* (Israel). Born and raised in *Moscow* (Russia). Speak: Hebrew, Russian and English.
