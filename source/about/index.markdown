I'm a tech junkie. Actively following Twitter, reading RSS feeds on daily basis, love to play with new toys, install new apps, hack different stuff and post about it. 

I work in [eToro](http://etoro.com) as R&D teams manager  (web developer at my past). We are building the social investment network called [Openbook](http://openbook.etoro.com) which supposed to help people invest their money smartly. Working there is challenging, eToro is developing, we need to think scale.

I'm an enthusiast photographer. I have started my photography hobby about 10 years ago. I shoot mostly landscape and street photography. You can find my photos at [500px](http://500px.com/virtser) or on my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/poison-dv/) page. 


I'm married and have two wonderful boys that keep me busy. Currently live in *Tel-Aviv* (Israel). Born and raised in *Moscow* (Russia). Speak: Hebrew, Russian and English.
