<p>It&#8217;s all started for me about 6 years ago, summer 2007. I left another startup in gambling industry in favor of <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a>, which looked very promising to me. I had an experience of few years as webmaster and web developer and I was at my last year of computer science studies in a collage. My main mission was to establish company websites.</p>

<p>We were very few developers in a fresh new startup company. And as any typical Israeli startup company of these years our focus was to build and deliver our products as fast as possible.</p>

<p>There were about 5 developers all in all when each was responsible to cover products in multiple fields. As web developer I was responsible
to build and maintain company websites, Affiliates system and Billing front-end.</p>

<p>In the first year the development process was almost unmanaged. We got requirements and requests for development by email or during a short brainstorm meeting in our CEO (<a href="http://yoniassia.com">Yoni Assia</a>) office. We had no revision control system, neither bug tracking system. And it all worked fine, as soon as we were a small team.</p>

<p>About a year later, as our needs and requirements increased, we had to recruit more developers to the teams. R&amp;D teams started to grow. We got more and more emails with development requests which we passed from one to other. It was endless email threads which can be hardly tracked.</p>

<p>At this point we decided to install our first revision control system to make audit of changes - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe">Microsoft Source Safe</a>. It was a real pain in the a*s to use it. It was eventually replaced by SVN which is better, but in bigger teams we had a branch merge hell with it.</p>

<p>Later on we also installed simple and intuitive bug tracking system which we are still using - <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/">FogBugz</a>. We have .NET stack here for 80% of our products, that was the main reason for using these tools.</p>

<p>We had dedicated QA team which did only &#8220;monkey testing&#8221;. We had no automation at all. No unit tests, integration test, test automation, performance test, load test. Nobody invested time in peer code reviews. Logs were a mess, same with monitoring. It was very hard to find and identify the source of the problem.</p>

<p>Our development was done on personal computers and we used them as our environments as well. Shared resources. Each team member could break others environment with his change.</p>

<p>No REST APIs at all, instead DLLs everywhere we need to communicate with other internal components.</p>

<p>Product lead R&amp;D but not the opposite. Developers has almost no power to decide.</p>

<p>We worked in waterfall software development methodology although it wasn&#8217;t formal. Our releases was very long and risky. It took months to release following by weeks to fix bugs of such big release.</p>

<p>And so on and on, you get the picture, right?</p>

<p>It was a nightmare&#8230;</p>

<p>In the next post Iâ€™m going to describe the current R&amp;D situation in <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a>.</p>
