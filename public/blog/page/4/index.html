		<p><img src="/images/logo.jpg" alt="First eToro logo - 2007" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s all started for me about 6 years ago, summer 2007. I left another startup in gambling industry in favor of <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a>, which looked very promising to me. I had an experience of few years as webmaster and web developer and I was at my last year of computer science studies in a collage. My main mission was to establish company websites.</p>

<p>We were very few developers in a fresh new startup company. And as any typical Israeli startup company of these years our focus was to build and deliver our products as fast as possible.</p>

<p>There were about 5 developers all in all when each was responsible to cover products in multiple fields. As web developer I was responsible
to build and maintain company websites, Affiliates system and Billing front-end.</p>

<p>In the first year the development process was almost unmanaged. We got requirements and requests for development by email or during a short brainstorm meeting in our CEO (<a href="http://yoniassia.com">Yoni Assia</a>) office. We had no revision control system, neither bug tracking system. And it all worked fine, as soon as we were a small team.</p>

<p>About a year later, as our needs and requirements increased, we had to recruit more developers to the teams. R&amp;D teams started to grow. We got more and more emails with development requests which we passed from one to other. It was endless email threads which can be hardly tracked.</p>

<p>At this point we decided to install our first revision control system to make audit of changes - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe">Microsoft Source Safe</a>. It was a real pain in the a*s to use it. It was eventually replaced by SVN which is better, but in bigger teams we had a branch merge hell with it.</p>

<p>Later on we also installed simple and intuitive bug tracking system which we are still using - <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/">FogBugz</a>. We have .NET stack here for 80% of our products, that was the main reason for using these tools.</p>

<p>We had dedicated QA team which did only &#8220;monkey testing&#8221;. We had no automation at all. No unit tests, integration test, test automation, performance test, load test. Nobody invested time in peer code reviews. Logs were a mess, same with monitoring. It was very hard to find and identify the source of the problem.</p>

<p>Our development was done on personal computers and we used them as our environments as well. Shared resources. Each team member could break others environment with his change.</p>

<p>No REST APIs at all, instead DLLs everywhere we need to communicate with other internal components.</p>

<p>Product lead R&amp;D but not the opposite. Developers has almost no power to decide.</p>

<p>We worked in waterfall software development methodology although it wasn&#8217;t formal. Our releases was very long and risky. It took months to release following by weeks to fix bugs of such big release.</p>

<p>And so on and on, you get the picture, right?</p>

<p>It was a nightmare&#8230;</p>

<p>In the next post Iâ€™m going to describe the current R&amp;D situation in <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With this post I&#8217;m starting a series of DevOps related posts. What is it, the past, the present and the future of DevOps in <a href="http://etoro.com">eToro</a> R&amp;D.</p>

<p>Lets start with basics and then drill down and expand to more details.</p>

<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>

<p>A formal definition taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals. DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. It aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although it is a fine but &#8220;dry&#8221; definition, I like the more simple one found in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/geekle/devops-5348895">this</a> presentation online:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>D</strong>ev<strong>O</strong>ps is an approach to bridge the gap between agile software <strong>D</strong>evelopment and <strong>O</strong>perations (IT).</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to write here anymore about DevOps as you can just find below my short DevOps high-level presentation that I wrote and presented internally for <a href="http://etoro.com">eToro</a> R&amp;D employees last week:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/18801475" width="597" height="486" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p>Hope you could understand from this presentation what is DevOps in general and what does it suppose to give us after implementation.</p>

<p>We have a very long way until it&#8217;s going to be implemented, but we are on the right path.</p>

<p>In the next post I&#8217;m going to describe in more details about <a href="http://etoro.com">eToro</a> past and how everything has started.</p>

<p>Keep on reading and as always, I will be glad to get your feedback. ;)</p>

		<p>This is a very first post in my new minimalistic geek blog based on <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a> framework for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> blogging.</p>

<p>It is supposed to be simple and easy to maintain. It supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> writing only, has no Admin section and you have to commit changes to <a href="https://github.com/virtser/octopress">GitHub</a> in order to publish a new post. So if I make a spelling mistake or type, you can fork the repository, fix it and make a pull request. ;)</p>

<p>I used to have several blogs in the past. One was a photography blog based on Wordpress, another photo blog in <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and the last one based on BlogEngine.Net with some own custom modifications was my personal blog.</p>

<p>All blogs I used to have, were in <em>Russian</em> only. It is my first attempt to write a blog in <em>English</em>. It supposed to serve all my <em>English</em>, <em>Russian</em> and <em>Hebrew</em> speaking friends.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to write here about the things that interest me and may be interesting to read for others as well. I&#8217;m going to share here stuff related to my workplace and hobbies. It is important for me to get feedback. So if you read a post and you care or have something to say about it, please comment or share with others. You can also subscribe to this blog <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/poisonsblog">RSS feed</a> to get updates.</p>

<p>I have to stop talking to myself as nobody read first blog posts&#8230;  :)</p>
