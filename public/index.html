<p>It is talking about measuring business values through code and it&#8217;s  importance.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a must see video for developers and product people, it can connect us better.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/2014/02/04/why-graphite/" itemprop="url">Why Graphite</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="http://graphite.wdfiles.com/local--files/screen-shots/graphite_fullscreen_800.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are many posts in the Internet about what is <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> and how to work with it. In this post I want to talk about why any professional engineer (developer) have to work with Graphite.</p>

<p>During my Graphite implementation sessions with engineers in <a href="http://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a> I felt difficulty to explain developers what is Graphite and why they want to use it instead (or in addition to) other monitoring tools.</p>

<p>We tried variety of different logging and monitoring tools in eToro in the last year. We are using log4net to save our logs in files. We used to work with <a href="https://logentries.com/">LogEntries</a> to store our logs in cloud, but we decided that it doesn&#8217;t precisely fit our needs and now we almost finished the migration to <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>. Splunk knows to do logs analysis better in addition to aggregations, correlations and dashboards.</p>

<p>We are also using <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> which is a great SaaS tool. You just need to install an agent on your web server and you get a great visibility on your application performance including database and external dependencies. But we faced few problems with it. Most of our applications are written in .NET and some types of applications like WCF, Web API or <a href="https://servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a> were not well supported by New Relic (could be that they added a better support by now) and returned wrong numbers if at all. In addition we found in some unknown cases that New Relic agent installed on IIS caused random application pool restarts.</p>

<p>And now before explaining why Graphite, I have to explain breifly about what is Graphite. Very rughly - Graphite is a metrics collector. You can report withing the code of your application counts, timers and gauges. You can count how many times some method in your application was called or the time it took to execute this method. You give your metric a name separated by dots and Graphite knows to break it and show it as a tree in its UI (see the screenshot above).</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="/images/api.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>We are in the process of building of solid APIs for each of <a href="http://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a> main domains. It is not an easy task at all, as we didn&#8217;t invest too much in the past 7 years of eToro existence in all the architectural aspects of the system.</p>

<p>How services interact with each other? Who is responsible of doing what? What are the standards that we are working with? Which tools or technology do we choose for specific task? All these questions were not answered until now. Today we start to talk and think about it along with progressing with our first real API - <strong>User API</strong>. It is the place where it all begins - user created for the first time, user details updated, etc&#8230;</p>

<p>Today we still have one Users table in our big database which holds all our customer records in addition to their basic details and more irrelevant to user stuff. Each application can update (or read) this table from code without going through a dedicated API. The problem with this approach is that there is no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Source_of_Truth">single source of truth</a> - each and every service can apply its own business logic to change user related data, which leading to data inconsistency.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m taking active role of product/project manager for this API and leading the integration process with teams. Our main goals we want to achieve by User API implementation are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create the &#8220;Single Source of Truth&#8221;. All the requests to register user, update it&#8217;s details or get data of some user will pass through one API which hold the business logic of the user domain. We love <a href="https://servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a> and we are using their framework for our REST APIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide notifications of user changes to different services via Pub/Sub instead of polling database for changes like we do today. We are using <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> messaging here.</p></li>
<li><p>Separate User related data to it&#8217;s own dedicated database. This to isolate and encapsulate the user domain better. It will help in many aspects - automatic deployment of database changes with CD process, creation of environments with empty user database, other services won&#8217;t effect this database performance and vice versa. We are working with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/tools.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools</a> to accompish this</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Today the User API is almost ready, but can&#8217;t be completed because we need to migrate all the clients to use it instead of DB first. After all the clients which update customer records migrate, we will be able to enable caching, provide Pub/Sub functionality which can be trusted and eventually take out the user data our of the main DB to a dedicated one.</p>

<p>Lessons learned so far during the API building and integration process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t start it when it&#8217;s too late - invest in your architecture from the beginning or at least think about it. Now it takes so many time to make the integration and fix things which were done wrongly in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a good plan - development plan (phases: establishment, optimization), integration plan (insert, update, select).</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t try to fix all evil at once, do it in small chunks, work iteratively. Otherwise it will hurt, it will bring more risk to migration.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the importance of this move to the company - management and developers. It is required for engagement of people to give higher priority for integration than any other tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication and follow up of progress are important to make the development and migration as fast as possible. You don&#8217;t want this project to take a lifetime.</p></li>
</ol>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="/images/focus.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Lets talk about Focus and its importance in our life. Bear with me.</p>

<p>I recently spent few hour of my time explaining to my colleagues from <a href="http://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a> broad management about how important is to make a focus. Many times, as a startup, we tempted to join a new venture or not to loose another opportunity of business development.</p>

<p>Today, when we are not a startup company anymore, these temptations became a solid products which are not a core of our business and they defocus us from the real product. We have less time to invest to make our main product better because we have to support the other products which became not important anymore.</p>

<p>For example, historically we developed support for many types of payments and we keep on supporting all of them because some users want them. But instead, if we choose to support only Credit Card and PayPal, but do it good, even perfect, we could generate the same amount of volume if not even more!</p>

<p>If we build a good product, people will use it. Lets make such product, so even customers who have no Credit Card or PayPal account will want to create one just in order to try our product. Just like I did this week with <a href="netflix.com">Netflix</a>, which is available for U.S. customers only. I opened a US PayPal account and bought a US VPN to have US IP address and now I watch Netflix in my TV with <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/">Chromecast</a>. This is because they built amazing product!</p>

<p>So I spoke with about 10 people from company broad management about focus and how we can say NO to things which are not important. I hope that I could transfer the message.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I succeed myself to push and shut down few legacy products which were running for a long time on background and nobody thought to stop them. I also was involved in &#8220;not starting&#8221; a new products initiative which are not in our main business and I&#8217;m proud of it. Unfortunately some people take this initiative personally, but these are not my intentions.</p>

<p><strong>Say NO</strong>! It is more important to say what you are not doing than what you are doing, define non-goals. Make a focus on stuff that really matters, the deal breakers, the stuff that are core of your business. If you can use SaaS services, use them, don&#8217;t build it yourself. And of course you can apply this rule not just in your work, but in your real life.</p>

<blockquote><p>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&#8217;ve got to focus on. But that&#8217;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&#8217;m actually as proud of the things we haven&#8217;t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” &#8211; Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>

<p>My <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100s">Fuji X100S</a> is on its way to me. I&#8217;m so excited about it that I started to learn more about it before I actually got it.</p>

<p>It took me a while to read all the articles in the Internet about the camera until I decided to order one and took some notes with all the useful pieces of information that I found in the Internet with references for myself.</p>

<p>But I think that it would be a good idea to share this list with you in random order as I noted (some notes may repeat). I hope you can find something new and useful there for you too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not the guy for great speeches, but still it was an amazing experience for me. People asked questions and was interested in the process we are running. We tried to be as open and transparent as possible, showing the good and bad things in the process. I hope it worked and we will be able to help others to kick-off the process in their organizations.  Will be happy to get your feedback.</p>
