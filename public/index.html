<p>There is like thousands of post talking about what is Docker and how to start
working with it, but there is no much posts explaining simply the motivation
behind it. So I decided to write one, as I see it.</p>

<p>I think its much more important to understand <strong>why</strong> than technical details of
<strong>how</strong>. When you understand <strong>why</strong>, you have the motivation to learn <strong>how</strong>.</p>

<p>OK, letâ€™s remind ourselves first about the old habits of how we used to work.
This to get a better reference of the problem.</p>

<p>We used to create dev/test/prod environments manually. It could work when your
team and environment are small. When team grows and you have to share those
dev/test environments, things start to go out of control. Such environments
arenâ€™t isolated and become inconsistent over time.</p>

<p>In many cases, those environments are not identical to production environment,
running on different machines or have different network/security conditions.
Which all resulting in unexpected bugs on production.</p>

<p>When team and environment grows, engineers canâ€™t keep up with constant changes
and additions of new components. It become impossible to install manually on
your local machine another dependency. This leads to creative solutions like
using some API/cache/db from another environment. ðŸ’©</p>

<p>This is where Docker will shine by turning your environment services
infrastructure into code. Which will be predictable, repeatable and consistent
between your engineers dev, your CI test and your production environments.</p>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s start with <strong>Docker</strong>, which is the basis for everything. It takes some
time to grasp the concept and how to work with it, like with any abstraction.
But believe me itâ€™s worth it.</p>

<p>Docker is using Linux core without need of creating virtual machines for each
container (service). As a result the best option as developer machine would be
Linux. Docker can run on Mac as well, but will require more resources to create
Docker virtual machine space. Sorry, I canâ€™t provide any feedback regarding
working with Docker in Windows OS as I never tried it. (If you did, please share
your experience in comments)</p>

<p>What does Docker container represent? A container is a single instance of one
component in your environment. Component can be for example web application,
API, worker, cache, database, or others.</p>

<p>What you define in service Docker file is which OS image to use as your
baseline, how to enrich it with your service dependencies, where to copy your
code from and how to run the service.</p>

<h3>Docker Compose</h3>

<p>Docker is nice when you want to spin up a single app/service. What makes it
really powerful is <strong>Docker Compose</strong> which creates a composition of Docker
containers that eventually represent your real application dev/test/prod
environment.</p>

<p>Docker composition describes the relationship between your services. Their
volumes, networks, links, configuration, etc..</p>

<p>It allows you to spin up the whole sandbox environment of services on your
machine. Fully isolated, your own environment. â˜º</p>

<p>I think thatâ€™s all you need to know to get the motivation to learn how to build
Docker containers and work with Composition.</p>

<p>If I could explain it simply, as next step, I suggest to follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/learn/">Docker
documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>When you are like me working in a team of web engineers, on a project which involves usage of external 3rd party libraries and you are usingÂ <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"><em>npm</em></a> and/orÂ <a href="http://bower.io/"><em>bower</em></a>Â to manage those dependencies, you probably will find it useful.</p>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>When you are working in a team and you are not keeping the 3rd party dependencies as part of your repository. Someone decides to add/remove/upgrade some dependency, they modifyÂ <em>package.json</em>Â or <em>bower.json</em>Â files reflecting the change and submits the change into repository.</p>

<p>Now you pull those changes into your local copy of the project and unless you run manuallyÂ <em>npm install</em>Â andÂ <em>bower install</em>Â you wonâ€™t have those dependencies updated for you locally. Which in most cases result to build/run errors or inconsistency.</p>

<h2>The solution:</h2>

<p>As we are working withÂ <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a>, I wrote a smallÂ <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-local-deps-update">grunt task</a>Â which helps detect and update dependencies ifÂ <em>package.json</em>Â orÂ <em>bower.json</em>Â files version was changed.</p>

<p>So from now on, when someone changes a dependency and bumps npm/bower version, grunt task will automatically update every team member local dependencies.</p>

<p>Which eliminates notifications, questions and increases productivity.Â :)</p>

<p>Feel free to use it:Â <br/>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="http://gruntjs.com/img/grunt-logo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you are a web developer and you are using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> as your default task runner, you probably in most of the cases use it from some inner folder of the project, something like &#8221;<em>client/app</em>&#8221;.</p>

<p>In this case, every time you want to work on your code using command like &#8221;<em>grunt serve</em>&#8221;, you need to change directory into <em>client/app</em> to run it all the time.</p>

<p>Below, I show you the way to make grunt commands work from root directory which makes your life more comfortable, eliminating the need switching to <em>client/app</em> directory all the time.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add in your original <em>client/app/Gruntfile.js</em> file the following code to let Grunt know the base directory location:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>module.exports = function(grunt) {
</span><span class='line'>  // Must have in order to work from root
</span><span class='line'>  grunt.file.setBase(__dirname);
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>2.. Add symbolic link in your root directory to original <em>client/app/Gruntfile.js</em> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ln -s client/app/Gruntfile.js Gruntfile.js</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>3.. Create <em>package.json</em> in root directory with grunt as dependency and install Grunt:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm init
</span><span class='line'>npm install grunt --save-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>4.. Run grunt from root to test it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt serve</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s it, pretty simple.
Hope you like it and use it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="/images/test_automation.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before we begin, I just want to make sure that we are on the same page about what is  &#8220;Test Automation&#8221;. For me, it is a way to automatically validate that a real user experiencing the predicted application behaviour. For example: User click on a button which should open a new window. In this case we need to automatically validate that user is able to click a button and a window will show up with predefined text. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation">Wikipedia: Test automation</a></p>

<p>Ideally, I wouldn&#8217;t recruit a test automation engineer at all. I beleive that software engineers should be capable to test their own code (as part of &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eat your own dog food</a>&#8221; concept) by writing unit, integration or end to end tests. It makes even a higher level of bond to the code that you are developing and need to maintain in the future.</p>

<p>But in reality, there are many reasons that might prevent you from living without QA position at all. It could be a culture of the organization that you are working in, legacy code that you need to deal with, could be the product nature that you are developing and etc&#8230; Moreover, you might need someone to own quality control in your organization.</p>

<p>My team was missing a QA person to take control of the product quality that we were  developing and take ownership of quality all in all. We wanted to do 80% of the testing automatically while covering the manual in the left 20%. I had a budget to recruit test automation engineer of junior to mid level.</p>

<p>How do you recruit a good junior engineer? You are looking for a potential which you need to find and validate by testing it. So I composed a simple exercise for test automation position interview. I gave it as homework after meeting a potential candidate which passed the initial screening.</p>

<p>I thought that it would be a nice exercise to use some SaaS tools to check our company website contact form. I choose to use <a href="https://saucelabs.com">Saucelabs</a> for test automation code execution in the cloud using Selenium web driver and <a href="https://loader.io">Loader</a> to do the load test.</p>

<p>I tried to make the test work myself, before I give this exercise for candidate, to make sure that it&#8217;s possible and to learn the field myself to feel more eligible. (I never did test automation before)</p>

<p>The main purpose of the exercise was to see how candidate can learn and deal with new tools, use them to write automation and summarize all his work in a document describing what and why it was done.</p>

<p>I sent the exercise as homework to few candidates asking them to send me results in 24 hours, including the test automation source code and document explaining the services and the work that was done.</p>

<p>Eventually I found this approach of testing candidates very effective. You could see weak candidates return partial test results or not returning results of tests at all. Strong candidates asked question and tried to accomplish the mission in the best way. Some even found bugs in our contact form by running their unique tests. :)</p>

<p>Hope you find it interesting. If you have any question, let me know.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="/images/bash.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I wanted to share few Linux bash (terminal) tips I found to be useful for me over the last year.</p>

<h1>1. Commands</h1>

<p><strong>cd -</strong> goes back to previous directory you have been at. useful when you accidentally switch to root dir for example.<br/>
<strong>!!</strong> - repeats your last command. most useful if you forgot to add sudo to last command: sudo !!<br/>
<strong>fuser -k tcp/8080</strong> - to find and kill a process which is using port 8080.<br/>
<strong>history</strong>  - shows you the history of commands you executed)<br/>
<strong>history | grep &#8216;git&#8217;</strong>  - will show you all the history items with word &#8216;git&#8217; in it</p>

<p>And now try <strong>Ctrl-R</strong> in terminal to open history search and type the desired search pattern.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you know that <strong>Ctrl-C</strong> cancels a process execution. Did you also know that <strong>Ctrl-Z</strong> pauses a process by putting it in background and releasing a prompt for you? To bring back the paused process type <strong>fg</strong> (ForeGround).</p>

<h1>2. Aliases</h1>

<p>You can also set some aliases for your most used commands in <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file:</p>

<p>My aliases are:</p>

<p><strong>alias ll=&#8217;ls -alF&#8217;<br/>
alias la=&#8217;ls -A&#8217;<br/>
alias l=&#8217;ls -CF&#8217;<br/>
alias cd..=&#8221;cd ..&#8221;<br/>
alias node=&#8217;nodejs&#8217;<br/>
alias s=&#8217;http-server -o -cors&#8217;</strong></p>

<h1>3. Prompt</h1>

<p>As well as define custom prompt colors and git branch you are working on, like I have for example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bash2.png" alt="" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If you are developing web application and you are working on client side, I hope you write unit tests or test automation or even both like we do. The following tips might be helpful if you write your tests using <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and execute it with <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma</a> or <a href="http://angular.github.io/protractor/">Protractor</a>.</p>

<p>I guess you already know that if you want to disable a specific test you can add &#8220;x&#8221; before <em>describe</em> or <em>it</em> statements?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>xdescribe('my beautiful function', function() {
</span><span class='line'> xit('having fun', function() {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'> });
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Did you also know that if you add &#8220;d&#8221; before <em>describe</em> or &#8220;i&#8221; before <em>it</em>, it will run only this specific test and skip the others?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ddescribe('my beautiful function', function() {
</span><span class='line'> iit('having fun', function() {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'> });
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is especially helpful when you need to focus on debugging specific test.</p>

<p>Hope you liked it.
If you have more tips to share, please do.</p>

<p>Few weeks ago I joined <a href="http://www.spectory.com/en">Spectory</a>, a small projects outsourcing company with great culture and people.</p>

<p>My job is to form and lead a new team of software engineers. Our mission is to build a new strategic product for Google using modern client side technologies.</p>

<p>The challenge is huge - get to know new people (Spectory and Google), form a new team and build a new product.</p>

<p>As part of my job, I&#8217;m and my team deployed at Google and working closely with Google teams and other vendors. We need to integrate well to make a progress.</p>

<p>I wanted to share with you my observations of Google culture after few weeks of work. I share it because I think its interesting and some facts were surprisingly new for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Work with a smile. Engineers, security guys, cooks and cleaning stuff  are nice. Everybody are willing to help and actually suggesting their help. I still didn&#8217;t hear someone rising their voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Although we are sitting in an open space, it is pretty quiet here. This is leading to productive and focused work.</p></li>
<li><p>As a developer you get a very powerful machine. You can order any enhancement (keyboard, cables, headphones, etc..) that will make your work environment even more comfortable. Nobody will ask you to justify your order and you will receive it quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>On your first month you have to learn a lot to get introduced with Google unique tools and standards. Google have a lot of great documentation resources like code labs, wiki and internal user groups.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a lot of technologies and different tools you have to work with as engineer in Google. Engineers are free to choose which tools or technologies work best for them. Even every team can choose to develop their own work flow which suits best their culture and product they are working on. Still, standards you should apply to exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements for new product development are usually not well defined and documented. It&#8217;s customer, product and engineering team responsibility to brainstorm and finalize it. Engineers have a lot of power to decide on product development paths and priorities.</p></li>
<li><p>Although it is an enterprise sometimes with its bureaucracy and politics, each team operates like a small start up. Trying to be as lean and iterative as possible delivering value fast to customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Last and most important aspect of this culture is the great professional  engineers working here. I think it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to build such culture without the people who get a lot of responsibility here.</p></li>
