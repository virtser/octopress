		<p>To alter slightly, this one is not a technical R&amp;D world related post, but my photograpjy hobby related one. Hope you don&#8217;t mind? Will followup with pictures. :)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.imaging-resource.com/ee_uploads/news/1391/x100s-front.jpg" alt="Fujifilm X100S" /></p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100s">Fuji X100S</a> is on its way to me. I&#8217;m so excited about it that I started to learn more about it before I actually got it. </p>

<p>It took me a while to read all the articles in the Internet about the camera until I decided to order one and took some notes with all the useful pieces of information that I found in the Internet with references for myself.</p>

<p>But I think that it would be a good idea to share this list with you in random order as I noted (some notes may repeat). I hope you can find something new and useful there for you too. </p>

<p><strong>1. </strong>In good lighting and with the focusing point made the largest, this camera is a focusing speed demon and perhaps right up there with Olympus’s FAST AF system. Make it smaller, and you have something on par with Canon’s EOS M camera.</p>

<p>And once again, we really need to recommend that you don’t focus and recompose with this camera. Sure it might be easier, but you’re just throwing off the focusing plane.<br/>
<a href="http://www.thephoblographer.com/2013/03/25/using-the-fujifilm-x100s-for-street-photography/">www.thephoblographer.com/2013/03/25/using-the-fujifilm-x1&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>The sweet spot with the X100s is to shoot on (L)100 ISO, at 1/1000th of a sec at f/2 with the built-in 3-stop ND filter engaged. That will underexpose full daylight. You can then overpower the sun with a small flash and shoot wide open in the process for gorgeous backgrounds at f/2<br/>
<a href="http://strobist.blogspot.co.il/2013/05/leaf-shutter-nd-flash-fuji-x100s.html">strobist.blogspot.co.il/2013/05/leaf-shutter-nd-flash-fuj&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> lose the slip-on lens cap and get a hood and a 49mm skylight filter. And not a crap filter, either, as the aspherical 23mm/2 (35mm/2 equiv.) lens deserves good glass in front. Put the lens cap in a drawer and go filter/hood full-time.<br/>

<p><strong>4. </strong>I normally configure my custom settings for +1 Color Boost and +1 Sharpness.</p>

<p>Function Button – You can assign a variety of functions to the function button (FN) for quick access. Things like ISO, ND Filter, Film Simulation etc. During the day, I set mine to turn off/on the ND filter. At night, or if I’m in a situation where I need ISO control, I’ll set it to ISO.<br/>

<p><strong>5. </strong>Great review and reason why x100s that convinced me<br/>
<a href="http://www.mitchellkphotos.com/blog/2013/10/15/istanbul-and-my-review-of-fuji-x100s/">www.mitchellkphotos.com/blog/2013/10/15/istanbul-and-my-r&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>6. </strong>Fujix x100s collection of all materials found in the net <br/>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wosimsphotography/fuji-x100s-testberichte-reviews">sites.google.com/site/wosimsphotography/fuji-x100s-testbe&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>7. </strong>If you use mostly the opti­cal finder, turn the “OVF power save mode” on. The display’s info will be dimmed a bit, and the live his­togram is no longer avail­able, but it will greatly extend the bat­tery life. I strongly rec­om­mend read­ing pages 18, 36, 41, 47, and 91 from the Camera’s Instruc­tion Man­ual.<br/>
<a href="http://www.eduardoangel.com/2013/11/12/fuji-x100s-hands-on-review/">www.eduardoangel.com/2013/11/12/fuji-x100s-hands-on-review/</a></p>

<p><strong>8. </strong>B&amp;W shooting tips:<br/>
My favorite B&amp;W setting on the X100S for most situations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Film simulation: B-R (B&amp;W Red Filter)</li>
<li>Sharpness: +1</li>
<li>Highlight Tone: 0</li>
<li>Shadow Tone: +1</li>
<li>Noise Reduction: -2</li>
</ul>


<p>And in case you don&#8217;t have a lot of experience with B&amp;W photography the Fuji X cameras with EVF or LCD will take you by the hand and guide you to your first successful exposures. When you switch your JPG to B&amp;W you will see a B&amp;W image in the EVF / LCD preview. Now use the exposure compensation dial (in Aperture priority mode) to increase or decrease the exposure and get a more predominant black or white look.</p>

<p>Still not sure if you want to deprive your exposures of the color for good? No problem! Set the Fuji X100S to shoot JPG + RAW and the RAW file will contain all of the color information just in case you change your mind later. The EVF will still show the B&amp;W preview.</p>

<p>So, are you ready to give it a try? Then why not just save the B&amp;W settings as one of your custom settings in your X100S for those occasions when you feel like shooting Monochrome :)<br/>
<a href="http://fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2013/10/the-Fuji-X100S-made-me-a-better-BW-photographer.html">fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2013/10/the-Fuji-X100S-made-me-&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>9. </strong>If maximum operating speed is important to you, then switch off all energy saving- and switch on all performance improving features. What also helps is when you use the fastest UHS-I SDHC cards. But with all energy saving turned off, I highly recommend that you buy at least one, or better yet, two spare batteries for your X100S.</p>

<p>The lens picks up some flare and this is identical to the lens on the original X100. Hence, I would buy the lens hood with adapter for two reasons:<br/>
A. To control flare.<br/>
B. To have a filter thread for the use of filter or simply to plug in a standard lens cap (49mm filter and lens cap for the adapter without the lens hood and a 52mm lens cap for use with the lens hood attached - you can see this on the second photo from the top). And do get the lens caps with the pinch release in the middle of the cap!</p>

<p>The X100S has turned into my every day take along camera. It is my street, portrait and city/landscape tool. And, I use it 95% of the time as a B&amp;W camera! I set the camera to record JPG + RAW and set the JPG to be captured in BW + Red Filter. This way the EVF and the review image in the EVF &amp; OVF will show a B&amp;W image which is closest to the way I would process it. The RAW file still contains the color information and will be rendered as a color image in my LightRoom collection, next to the B&amp;W JPG image.</p>

<p>I find that seeing a scene in B&amp;W is less distracting and lets me focus more intensely on the subject and situation of the scene.</p>

<p>These are my preferred every day settings when I&#8217;m out with the X100S:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fn = ND Filter (heavily used in bright conditions to overcome the f2 &amp; 1/1000s limit)</li>
<li>RAW + JPG</li>
<li>ISO: Auto 6400 at 1/100s (I&#8217;d rather take a bit more noise than motion blur)</li>
<li>Film simulation: B-R (B&amp;W Red Filter)</li>
<li>Sharpness: +1</li>
<li>Highlight Tone: 0</li>
<li>Shadow Tone: +1</li>
<li>Noise Reduction: -2</li>
<li>MF Assist: Max</li>
<li>High Performance Mode: On</li>
<li>Power Saving: Off</li>
<li>Review Time: 0.5 S</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>10. </strong>Focusing tips relevant for x100s as well <br/>
<a href="http://www.fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2012/08/fuji-x-pro-1-af-autofocus-speed-and.html">www.fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2012/08/fuji-x-pro-1-af-aut&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>11.</strong> Optical viewfinder prallax explained in details <br/>
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2011/07/ps-to-the-fuji-x100-review-parallax.html">theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>12. </strong> When you are shooting objects that quickly move towards the camera, better use the famous “Autofocus Trick”, also known as “shutter mash technique”: Set the camera to AF-S or AF-C (use AF-S if you want to assign a particular AF field, use AF-C if you are okay with the center spot or area) and press the shutter all the way through in one quick, swift motion (no half-pressing!) while keeping the AF field trained over the area of your subject that you want to be in focus. Since the X100S operates with Autofocus Priority, it won’t take the shot until it has actually locked focus (or until it gave up, in which case the shot will probably be wasted).</p>

<p>Shortcuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press and hold the Q button for a few seconds to clearly increase the brightness of the LCD. This can be quite helpful when operating the camera in bright light, like on a sunny day.</li>
<li>Press and hold the MENU/OK button down to lock or unlock the arrow keys and the Q button.</li>
<li>A long press of the Fn button will bring up the Fn button’s configuration menu, where you can assign one of several functions. I typically assign ISO to this button, because I like to be able to quickly change my Auto-ISO configuration (minimum shutter speed). Another popular option for this button is enabling the camera’s built-in ND filter.</li>
<li>Press and hold DISP/BACK button to activate (or deactivate) the camera’s Silent Mode. When this mode is turned on, the X100S functions quietly and inconspicuously. It won’t make any artificial noises and it abstains from using both the flash and the AF-assist lamp.</li>
<li>Pressing the DISP/BACK button while selecting an AF field in AF-S Area mode will immediately select the central AF field.</li>
<li>Press DISP/BACK in shooting or playback mode to change the view of the currently active display. This means that in order to change the view of either the OVF, the EVF or the LCD, either the OVF, EVF or LCD must be active when you press the button. You can select the display you want to change with the VIEW MODE button. Alternatively, use the eye-sensor to activate a display by looking through it, then change its view with the DISP/BACK button. The X100S can’t read your mind, you need to tell it which display’s view you want to change. </li>
<li>Finally, to check (or upgrade) the firmware version of the camera, press and hold the DISP/BACK button while switching on the camera.</li>
<li>In manual focus mode, press the AE-L/AF-L button to initiate an autofocus run.</li>
<li>Also in manual focus mode, press and hold the command dial to cycle through the camera’s different MF aids: standard, digital split image and focus peaking.</li>
<li>Press (but do not hold) the command dial to enlarge the current image to inspect its sharpness. This works in both MF and AF modes.</li>
<li>Rather than selecting a function in the shooting menu by pressing the OK button, you can press the shutter button halfway down. Pressing the shutter button halfway down while in playback mode switches the camera directly into shooting mode. You can wake the camera by pressing the shutter button halfway down as well.</li>
<li>Double-tap the macro button to switch between normal and macro modes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14.</strong> JJC hood and B+W Pro filter: Protection. spend a few dollars, put these on and keep them there. I don&#8217;t use a cap on this camera (they come off and I lose them). But don&#8217;t use a cheap filter. B + W are the best. German made, pure optics. Whats the point of having a camera with the best sensor and glass, if you stick cheap distorted junk in front of it. $50 won&#8217;t break the bank! The hood stops glare and adds more protection. You can spend $$ for the fuji one, or $ for a nasty el cheapo. Spend $ and get the JJC. as good as the real thing, but not flimsy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not the guy for great speeches, but still it was an amazing experience for me. People asked questions and was interested in the process we are running. We tried to be as open and transparent as possible, showing the good and bad things in the process. I hope it worked and we will be able to help others to kick-off the process in their organizations.  Will be happy to get your feedback.</p>

		<p>Well, it took me a while to get back to life after a huge jet lag hit me badly. Surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t that hard when I went from here to San Francisco, but it was much harder to come back to Israel. 10 hour difference in time zones do the thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back from 10 days business and pleasure trip to Bay Area - San Francisco, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Paulo Alto, Cupertino, Saratoga (AKA Silicon Valley), San Jose and Santa Cruz. Here is a classic postcard picture I took in San Francisco:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7294/9138679173_f71502b827_b.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge © David Virtser" /></p>

<p>We spent 2 days in San Francisco just traveling for pleasure,  followed by 4 intensive days of <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/">Velocity</a> and <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-mountainview/">DevOpsDays</a> conferences in Santa Clara. The former is expensive, very big, public, focused on Web Performance and Operations. The latter is small, private, focused of DevOps culture.</p>

<p>The conferences were different, but both very good. The reason I go there was to learn more about DevOps culture from experience of real companies and people who do it in modern web industry. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Netflix and others.</p>

<p>Few insights that I marked to myself and were repeated over and over again on number of different sessions which are important for a company to be Agile/Lean:</p>

<li><p><strong>Make a focus</strong> - Great companies do one product, but do it outstanding. They focus on their product whole holistic experience - how it looks, how it feels, how responsive is it, how reliable is it, how easy is it, how intuitive is it, how much time does it take to get an answer from customer support and etc… They invest most of the time in robust and scalable infrastructure, in performance of the applications, in fixing bugs, optimizing and analyzing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recruit professionals</strong> - experienced, full-stack developers are expensive, but in long run they worth it. You can have a lot of developers with potential, but still they need a senior to show them the right path and explain how things work in real world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging &amp; Monitoring</strong> - more than half of the booths and sessions in conferences where about monitoring and measuring of applications in production. It&#8217;s extremely important to invest in this area. The tools that where mentioned the most: <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a>, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, <a href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a>/<a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open source everything</strong> - open sourcing your code is coming with great responsibility to support the community (pull request, issues), but it also teaches you how to write good application -  tests, documentation, generic code, etc.. If you do it right, you will get help back from community. Open sourcing is social  programming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bootcamps</strong> - workshops, lectures. It&#8217;s a common practice. Do it more to train your people and get them involved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft</strong> - Windows, .NET world is a dead end. It&#8217;s hardly  scalable (MS SQL Server), slower (IIS), harder to operate, complicated automation, requires stronger hardware and more.</p></li>
</ol>

		<p><img src="/images/EToro_logo_facebook_profile.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Few months ago we started to get the vibes of change.</p>

<p>I think all started when <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a> hosted it&#8217;s first private <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathon</a>. All the company activities where paused for 48 hours in favor of the hack. Everyone could join the effort from HR to R&amp;D teams. It was an amazing experience, when ideas of people who never had a chance to make a change and create something for our customers where chosen and brought to live.</p>

<p>We started thinking and talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization">flat organization</a> structure, how do we implement and encourage developers mobility in teams. A new term &#8220;Develorship&#8221; was introduces, which is talking about that any independent developer can take and lead a projects A to Z. We are working to shift the power of choice from Product to Development of what is important to ship now.</p>

<p>Followed by our visit to <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, a successful Israeli company which does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continues Delivery</a> and host millions of customized websites. At <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> we met <a href="http://www.aviransplace.com">Aviran Mordo</a>, a Back-end Group Manager, who gave us a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aviranwix/scaling-up-to-30-m-users">presentation</a> about the switch to Continues Delivery that they did and answered a lot of our questions.</p>

<p>After the visit we started to read and think about Continues Delivery and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>. How do we optimize our process? How do we make non blocking development? How do we automate everything that can be automated? And more questions that should be answered… We realized that we can&#8217;t continue the same way we did until now and we need to think how to get to Continues Delivery.</p>

<p>To answer these questions, a DevOps forum was established. A forum of 5 key people from each department in R&amp;D. I was one of them. It&#8217;s mission was to map our problems in current development process and suggest a plan how to implement Continues Delivery in the company.</p>

<p>After few offsite meeting of the forum we mapped all the problems and suggested an aggressive plan how to get to Continues Delivery in about 1 year. The plan included two parts:</p>

<p>1) Establishment of dedicated DevOps team to work on R&amp;D culture, make a focus on Continues Integration and Delivery process, establish logging &amp; monitoring expertise, minimize our gaps in Database automation and reorganization of our IT department main processes.</p>

<p>2) Working with existing R&amp;D teams to learn and implement Test Driven Development, write more unit tests, write integration test, implement more test automation to make our regressions test faster and more efficient, working on better logging &amp; monitoring of our existing systems, etc…</p>

<p>The plan was delivered to the management and we got their blessing  and full backup to go for it. Without management support you can&#8217;t do it. To start working on #2 immediately freestyle Tuesdays where established in the company. A free day of regular iteration work where people can choose what they work on. It can be check your production logs, write more tests, do some automation, listen to lectures, anything that can make your work process better.</p>

<p>I was chosen and volunteered to lead the DevOps effort in the company as I have the experience and understanding of the processes in the company just because I work in <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a> since the beginning. I left my previous role of managing few R&amp;D teams and established a new DevOps team which I&#8217;m working at the moment on it&#8217;s recruitment.</p>

<p>We realize that there is a lot of work to be done, we have a lot of cultural and technological gaps, but now we have an isolated environment to make the focus to work on <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a> R&amp;D strategy and bring the change.</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to get updated on our progress as time goes by.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy the story. :)</p>
