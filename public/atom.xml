    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s all started, at least for me, about 6 years ago (at 2008). We were very few developers in a fresh new startup company.
And as any typical Israeli startup company of these years our focus was to build and deliver our products as fast as possible.</p>

<p>There were about 5 developers when each was responsible to cover products in multiple fields. As web developer I was responsible
to build and maintain company websites, Affiliates system and Billing front end. In the first year the development process was
almost unmanaged. We got requirements and requests for features development by email or on a short meeting. We had no revision
control system, neither bug tracking system. And it all worked fine, as soon as we were a small team.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With this post I&#8217;m starting a series of DevOps related posts. What is it, the past, the present and the future of DevOps in <a href="http://etoro.com">eToro</a> R&amp;D.</p>

<p>Lets start with basics and then drill down and expand to more details.</p>

<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>

<p>A formal definition taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals. DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. It aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although it is a fine but &#8220;dry&#8221; definition, I like the more simple one found in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/geekle/devops-5348895">this</a> presentation online:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>D</strong>ev<strong>O</strong>ps is an approach to bridge the gap between agile software <strong>D</strong>evelopment and <strong>O</strong>perations (IT).</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to write here anymore about DevOps as you can just find below my short DevOps high-level presentation that I wrote and presented internally for <a href="http://etoro.com">eToro</a> R&amp;D employees last week:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/18801475" width="597" height="486" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>


<p>Hope you could understand from this presentation what is DevOps in general and what does it suppose to give us after implementation.</p>

<p>We have a very long way until it&#8217;s going to be implemented, but we are on the right path.</p>

<p>In the next post I&#8217;m going to describe in more details about <a href="http://etoro.com">eToro</a> past and how everything has started.</p>

<p>Keep on reading and as always, I will be glad to get your feedback. ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a very first post in my new minimalistic geek blog based on <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a> framework for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> blogging.</p>

<p>It is supposed to be simple and easy to maintain. It supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> writing only, has no Admin section and you have to commit changes to <a href="https://github.com/virtser/octopress">GitHub</a> in order to publish a new post. So if I make a spelling mistake or type, you can fork the repository, fix it and make a pull request. ;)</p>

<p>I used to have several blogs in the past. One was a photography blog based on Wordpress, another photo blog in <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and the last one based on BlogEngine.Net with some own custom modifications was my personal blog.</p>

<p>All blogs I used to have, were in <em>Russian</em> only. It is my first attempt to write a blog in <em>English</em>. It supposed to serve all my <em>English</em>, <em>Russian</em> and <em>Hebrew</em> speaking friends.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to write here about the things that interest me and may be interesting to read for others as well. I&#8217;m going to share here stuff related to my workplace and hobbies. It is important for me to get feedback. So if you read a post and you care or have something to say about it, please comment or share with others. You can also subscribe to this blog <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/poisonsblog">RSS feed</a> to get updates.</p>

<p>I have to stop talking to myself as nobody read first blog posts&#8230;  :)</p>
