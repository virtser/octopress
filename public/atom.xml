    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://virtser.net/images/google.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Few weeks ago I joined <a href="http://www.spectory.com/en">Spectory</a>, a small projects outsourcing company with great culture and people.</p>

<p>My job is to form and lead a new team of software engineers. Our mission is to build a new strategic product for Google using modern client side technologies.</p>

<p>The challenge is huge - get to know new people (Spectory and Google), form a new team and build a new product.</p>

<p>As part of my job, I&#8217;m and my team deployed at Google and working closely with Google teams and other vendors. We need to integrate well to make a progress.</p>

<p>I wanted to share with you my observations of Google culture after few weeks of work. I share it because I think its interesting and some were surprisingly new for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Work with a smile. Engineers, security guys, cooks and cleaning stuff  are nice. Everybody are willing to help and actually suggesting their help. I still didn&#8217;t hear someone rising their voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Although we are sitting in an open space, it is pretty quite here. This is leading to productive and focused work.</p></li>
<li><p>As a developer you get a very powerful machine. You can order any enhancement (keyboard, cables, headphones, etc..) that will make your work environment even more comfortable. Nobody will ask you to justify your order and you will receive it quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>On your first month you have to learn a lot to get introduced with Google unique tools and standards. Google have a lot of great documentation resources like code labs, wiki and internal user groups.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a lot of technologies and different tools you have to work with as engineer in Google. Engineers are free to choose which tools or technologies work best for them. Even every team can choose to develop their own work flow which suits best their culture and product they are working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements for new product development are usually not well defined. It&#8217;s customer, product and engineering team responsibility to brainstorm and finalize it. Engineers have a lot of power to decide on product development paths and priorities.</p></li>
<li><p>Although it is an enterprise sometimes with its bureaucracy and politics, each team operates like a small start up. Trying to be as lean and iterative as possible delivering value fast to customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Last and most important aspect of this culture is the great professional  engineers working here. I think it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to build such culture without the people who get a lot of responsibility here.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To be continued&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://virtser.net/images/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn views chart" /></p>

<p>I left eToro about 2 months ago and started to look for a new challenge. It was my first time actively looking for a job and trying to &#8220;sell&#8221; myself. :)</p>

<p>Below you will find a list of things I learned from the process of looking for a new job:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you can afford it, leave your current job before you found a new one. It gives you more time to look for a new job and you can do it transparently without hiding. That&#8217;s what I did.</p></li>
<li><p>At the beginning, you have to understand what kind of job and in which type of company you are looking for. This is good for training on your pitch and to make a focus. When you know what you are looking, you can decline job opportunities which looks less appealing for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking for a new job is fun. You have the opportunity to meet a lot of new interesting and sometimes inspiring people. Quit your job now! :)</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t trust recruitment agencies. Their recruitment procedures are outdated and not aligned with real market needs. Use social networks and your connections.</p></li>
<li><p>LinkedIn is working. Add a new company and call it &#8220;Looking for new challenges/opportunities&#8221; in your LinkedIn profile. You will receive 300% increase in profile views and at least one new job opportunity a day in your private inbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for people (team) and culture, but not for product, company or technology stack. You have to work with people at the end of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>It takes time to open your mind after a long period employed in one place. Meet old friends who were working with you and who you respect, see what they are doing. It will give you more ideas or maybe you can join forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn something new, you have plenty of free time now. Read books you always wanted to read, but couldn&#8217;t do it because you were busy at work. Learn that new technology and hack something. Spare more time with your family, kids, yourself. You won&#8217;t have this time for long.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Let me know what you think and if you have some other findings.</p>

    <link href="http://virtser.net/2014/06/26/vagrant-and-ansible/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-26T16:08:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://virtser.net/2014/06/26/vagrant-and-ansible</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend few hours recently to learn about <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> to understand better how these tools work together. I&#8217;m really excited of potential hiding behind them. Unfortunately not many developers/companies know these tools and using them. So I wanted to share with you what I learned and hope it will help you to discover a concept called &#8220;Infrastrucutre as a code&#8221; if you didn&#8217;t know about it before.</p>

<h2>Vagrant</h2>

<p><img style="float: right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Vagrant.png" width="100px" hspace="5"/></p>

<p>Basically Vagrant provides you with functionality to create, provision and configure your own isolated development environment. It can be a single machine or number of machines connected in private network. Depends on your application infrastructure. All it does is creates on your laptop a defined set of virtual machines using (by default) VirtualBox. These machines actually defines your development environment.</p>

<p>Vagrant saves its configuration in <em>Vagrantfile</em> which is stored as part of your projects root. It should be also saved in source control as part of your project as it defines how your environment look like and how to create it from scratch if needed. Click <a href="https://github.com/virtser/vagrantansible/blob/master/Vagrantfile">here</a> to see how a typical Vagrant file looks like.</p>

<p><em>Vagrantfile</em> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Definition of your VMs (which boxes: Linux, Windows, etc&#8230;)</li>
<li>Network settings (port forwarding, private network, etc&#8230;)</li>
<li>Provisioning (how to setup a VM after creation from clean box)</li>
<li>and more other but less useful stuff&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>I won&#8217;t dive into more details. I hope you got the point and if you want to read more about why using Vagrant and what does it provide, you can go <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Ansible</h2>

<p><img style="float: right" src="http://bundles.kunstmaan.be/uploads/media/52f2178e8b342.png" width="100px" hspace="5"/> Ansible is a lightweight, simpler and easier to on board alternative for widely known Chef and Puppet configuration management tools. Like their big brothers its mission is to allow smart provisioning, deployment and configuration management of servers.</p>

<p>Ansible uses a <em>hosts</em> file to define how your environment look like. You can create groups of identical servers as well. Groups are good to define a set of similar machines for later mass provisioning. Example of such file can be found <a href="https://github.com/virtser/vagrantansible/blob/master/Ansible/hosts">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ansible saves its configuration in YAML files called &#8220;playbooks&#8221; which actually defines how to provision server or number of servers. Example of such file can be found <a href="https://github.com/virtser/vagrantansible/blob/master/Ansible/front.yml">here</a>.</p>

<p>Same as with Vagrant, you save these YAML files along side with your project, because they define how to build your environment.</p>

<p>You can read more about why using Ansible and what does it provide  <a href="http://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Vagrant and Ansible integration</h2>

<p>Vagrant as part of its configuration knows to call Ansible playbooks to provision the VMs that where created. It also automatically creates a hosts file to define the environment for Ansible and to make sure you will be able to provision the Vagrant machines from your laptop.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if you heard the term &#8220;Infrastructure as a code&#8221;, but these tools actually does exactly that. Which means that you are writing code to define your infrastructure, saving it as part of source control and that you will be able to re-create it at any given time. Whenever it is in development, testing or production environments. That gives you great power to keep your environment infrastructure consistent, testable and repeatable!</p>

<p>Hope it was useful and made you think about how you should work. :)</p>

<p>I created the following example for you in GitHub if you want to play with it a little: <a href="https://github.com/virtser/vagrantansible">https://github.com/virtser/vagrantansible</a></p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Why Graphite]]></title>
    <link href="http://virtser.net/2014/02/04/why-graphite/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-04T20:58:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://virtser.net/2014/02/04/why-graphite</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://graphite.wdfiles.com/local--files/screen-shots/graphite_fullscreen_800.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are many posts in the Internet about what is <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> and how to work with it. In this post I want to talk about why any professional engineer (developer) have to work with Graphite.</p>

<p>During my Graphite implementation sessions with engineers in <a href="http://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a> I felt difficulty to explain developers what is Graphite and why they want to use it instead (or in addition to) other monitoring tools.</p>

<p>We tried variety of different logging and monitoring tools in eToro in the last year. We are using log4net to save our logs in files. We used to work with <a href="https://logentries.com/">LogEntries</a> to store our logs in cloud, but we decided that it doesn&#8217;t precisely fit our needs and now we almost finished the migration to <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>. Splunk knows to do logs analysis better in addition to aggregations, correlations and dashboards.</p>

<p>We are also using <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> which is a great SaaS tool. You just need to install an agent on your web server and you get a great visibility on your application performance including database and external dependencies. But we faced few problems with it. Most of our applications are written in .NET and some types of applications like WCF, Web API or <a href="https://servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a> were not well supported by New Relic (could be that they added a better support by now) and returned wrong numbers if at all. In addition we found in some unknown cases that New Relic agent installed on IIS caused random application pool restarts.</p>

<p>And now before explaining why Graphite, I have to explain breifly about what is Graphite. Very rughly - Graphite is a metrics collector. You can report withing the code of your application counts, timers and gauges. You can count how many times some method in your application was called or the time it took to execute this method. You give your metric a name separated by dots and Graphite knows to break it and show it as a tree in its UI (see the screenshot above).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For example, you can count successful user sign ups by adding the following line in your code where you are sure that the sign up completed:</p>

<p><code>StatsdClient.Metrics.Counter("eToro.SignUp.Success");</code></p>

<p>or failed:</p>

<p><code>StatsdClient.Metrics.Counter("eToro.SignUp.Failure");</code></p>

<p>or measure the latency of sign up method:</p>

<p><code>StatsdClient.Metrics.Timer("eToro.SignUp", elapsedTime);</code></p>

<p>By the way, timers includes counters as well. You don&#8217;t have to count the call again if you time it.</p>

<ul>
<li>In this example I&#8217;m using <a href="https://github.com/goncalopereira/statsd-csharp-client">StatsD C# Client</a></li>
</ul>


<p>StatsD is a client which received the metrics by UDP, process it, applies some math function and stores it in Graphite. (this in not 100% correct, I wrote it as I wrote in favor of explanation  simplicity)</p>

<p>So now, when you have some high level clue about what you can do with Graphite, we will talk why we (as developers) have to use Graphite.</p>

<p><strong>Graphite advantages:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Once Graphite and StatsD servers are installed and all the required ports are open in firewall to accept UPD connections it requires absolutely no IT intervention, but only for regular daily monitoring and maintenance of up time. I mean that we, as developers, can independently add new metric to our code and it  will be immidiately created and shown in Graphite when you deploy the application to production.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphite gives power to developers. We control where to place our metrics, how do they behave and how we build our graphs based on these metrics. In case of New Relic, it is a black box, you never know when do they start to measure some metric and when do they stop. In case of Graphite you know exactly where to start measuring time and where to stop it, it gives you depth. We also have full control on the name of the metrics. You can include withing the code scope to metric name some dynamic parameters like &#8220;machine name&#8221; for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphite is non blocking. You report your metrics over UDP which is non blocking protocol. You can do it synchronously in your code and even if Graphite server is not responding, your application will work as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphite knows to smartly aggregate your data and shrink it over time. You can define it for example to keep every second of data in the first week, then every minute in the first month, then every date in the first year. This way you don&#8217;t have to keep tons of metrics and you know exactly the file size of each metric.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphite is very easy to work with. After reporting a metric, it is a matter of one click on that metric and you can see your metric graph. You can easily drop one graph to another to merge them and see in one window. You can apply math functions on your graphs and save multiple graph windows as dashboards. And more&#8230;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Ofcourse you can report counters and timers to your logs and then ask Splunk to collect the logs, process them and build some nice dashboards, but why? If you have like millions of lets say impressions or click you need to count? It make no sense to flood your logs with data which you want to see as graph. Logs are meant to keep your errors and debug info if required, keep them as clean as possible, otherwise it will be hard to analyse.</p>

<p>With Graphite you should measure every method in your application and all your external dependencies like database calls, cache hit/miss, messaging. Its up to you and your application business logic.</p>

<p>Another code example where we created a custom .NET [<em>GraphiteTiming</em>] attribute using  <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/">PostSharp</a> library in order to do quick metrics instumentation of each method in a class (if you set the attribute on class level) to measure time (and number of executions) in addition to counting the exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public sealed class GraphiteTimingAttribute : OnMethodBoundaryAspect
{
    [NonSerialized]
    private Stopwatch _stopwatch;

    public override void OnEntry(MethodExecutionArgs args)
    {
        _stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        base.OnEntry(args);
    }

    public override void OnExit(MethodExecutionArgs args)
    {
            StatsdClient.Metrics.Timer(
                string.Format("{0}.{1}.{2}.{3}", 
                "ApplicationName", 
                System.Environment.MachineName, 
                args.Method.DeclaringType.Name, 
                args.Method.Name), 
                (int)_stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds
            );
        base.OnExit(args);
    }

    public override void OnException(MethodExecutionArgs args)
    {
        StatsdClient.Metrics.Counter(
            string.Format("{0}.{1}.error",
            args.Method.DeclaringType.Name,
            args.Method.Name),
            (int)_stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds);
        base.OnException(args);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t try Graphite yet, you should definitely do! It gives you &#8220;eyes&#8221; and power to see what is happening with your application in real time.</p>

<p>Like some wise man said, life of a good developer splits to two parts - before Graphite and after Graphite. ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://virtser.net/images/api.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>We are in the process of building of solid APIs for each of <a href="http://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a> main domains. It is not an easy task at all, as we didn&#8217;t invest too much in the past 7 years of eToro existence in all the architectural aspects of the system.</p>

<p>How services interact with each other? Who is responsible of doing what? What are the standards that we are working with? Which tools or technology do we choose for specific task? All these questions were not answered until now. Today we start to talk and think about it along with progressing with our first real API - <strong>User API</strong>. It is the place where it all begins - user created for the first time, user details updated, etc&#8230;</p>

<p>Today we still have one Users table in our big database which holds all our customer records in addition to their basic details and more irrelevant to user stuff. Each application can update (or read) this table from code without going through a dedicated API. The problem with this approach is that there is no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Source_of_Truth">single source of truth</a> - each and every service can apply its own business logic to change user related data, which leading to data inconsistency.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m taking active role of product/project manager for this API and leading the integration process with teams. Our main goals we want to achieve by User API implementation are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create the &#8220;Single Source of Truth&#8221;. All the requests to register user, update it&#8217;s details or get data of some user will pass through one API which hold the business logic of the user domain. We love <a href="https://servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a> and we are using their framework for our REST APIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide notifications of user changes to different services via Pub/Sub instead of polling database for changes like we do today. We are using <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> messaging here.</p></li>
<li><p>Separate User related data to it&#8217;s own dedicated database. This to isolate and encapsulate the user domain better. It will help in many aspects - automatic deployment of database changes with CD process, creation of environments with empty user database, other services won&#8217;t effect this database performance and vice versa. We are working with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/tools.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools</a> to accompish this</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Today the User API is almost ready, but can&#8217;t be completed because we need to migrate all the clients to use it instead of DB first. After all the clients which update customer records migrate, we will be able to enable caching, provide Pub/Sub functionality which can be trusted and eventually take out the user data our of the main DB to a dedicated one.</p>

<p>Lessons learned so far during the API building and integration process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t start it when it&#8217;s too late - invest in your architecture from the beginning or at least think about it. Now it takes so many time to make the integration and fix things which were done wrongly in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a good plan - development plan (phases: establishment, optimization), integration plan (insert, update, select).</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t try to fix all evil at once, do it in small chunks, work iteratively. Otherwise it will hurt, it will bring more risk to migration.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the importance of this move to the company - management and developers. It is required for engagement of people to give higher priority for integration than any other tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication and follow up of progress are important to make the development and migration as fast as possible. You don&#8217;t want this project to take a lifetime.</p></li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://virtser.net/2014/01/22/focus/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-22T16:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://virtser.net/2014/01/22/focus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://virtser.net/images/focus.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Lets talk about Focus and its importance in our life. Bear with me.</p>

<p>I recently spent few hour of my time explaining to my colleagues from <a href="http://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a> broad management about how important is to make a focus. Many times, as a startup, we tempted to join a new venture or not to loose another opportunity of business development.</p>

<p>Today, when we are not a startup company anymore, these temptations became a solid products which are not a core of our business and they defocus us from the real product. We have less time to invest to make our main product better because we have to support the other products which became not important anymore.</p>

<p>For example, historically we developed support for many types of payments and we keep on supporting all of them because some users want them. But instead, if we choose to support only Credit Card and PayPal, but do it good, even perfect, we could generate the same amount of volume if not even more!</p>

<p>If we build a good product, people will use it. Lets make such product, so even customers who have no Credit Card or PayPal account will want to create one just in order to try our product. Just like I did this week with <a href="netflix.com">Netflix</a>, which is available for U.S. customers only. I opened a US PayPal account and bought a US VPN to have US IP address and now I watch Netflix in my TV with <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/">Chromecast</a>. This is because they built amazing product!</p>

<p>So I spoke with about 10 people from company broad management about focus and how we can say NO to things which are not important. I hope that I could transfer the message.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I succeed myself to push and shut down few legacy products which were running for a long time on background and nobody thought to stop them. I also was involved in &#8220;not starting&#8221; a new products initiative which are not in our main business and I&#8217;m proud of it. Unfortunately some people take this initiative personally, but these are not my intentions.</p>

<p><strong>Say NO</strong>! It is more important to say what you are not doing than what you are doing, define non-goals. Make a focus on stuff that really matters, the deal breakers, the stuff that are core of your business. If you can use SaaS services, use them, don&#8217;t build it yourself. And of course you can apply this rule not just in your work, but in your real life.</p>

<blockquote><p>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&#8217;ve got to focus on. But that&#8217;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&#8217;m actually as proud of the things we haven&#8217;t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” &#8211; Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://virtser.net/2013/11/24/fujifilm-x100s-tips-and-tricks/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-24T23:33:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://virtser.net/2013/11/24/fujifilm-x100s-tips-and-tricks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To alter slightly, this one is not a technical R&amp;D world related post, but my photograpjy hobby related one. Hope you don&#8217;t mind? Will followup with pictures. :)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.imaging-resource.com/ee_uploads/news/1391/x100s-front.jpg" alt="Fujifilm X100S" /></p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100s">Fuji X100S</a> is on its way to me. I&#8217;m so excited about it that I started to learn more about it before I actually got it.</p>

<p>It took me a while to read all the articles in the Internet about the camera until I decided to order one and took some notes with all the useful pieces of information that I found in the Internet with references for myself.</p>

<p>But I think that it would be a good idea to share this list with you in random order as I noted (some notes may repeat). I hope you can find something new and useful there for you too.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>1. </strong>In good lighting and with the focusing point made the largest, this camera is a focusing speed demon and perhaps right up there with Olympus’s FAST AF system. Make it smaller, and you have something on par with Canon’s EOS M camera.</p>

<p>And once again, we really need to recommend that you don’t focus and recompose with this camera. Sure it might be easier, but you’re just throwing off the focusing plane.<br/>
<a href="http://www.thephoblographer.com/2013/03/25/using-the-fujifilm-x100s-for-street-photography/">www.thephoblographer.com/2013/03/25/using-the-fujifilm-x1&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>The sweet spot with the X100s is to shoot on (L)100 ISO, at 1/1000th of a sec at f/2 with the built-in 3-stop ND filter engaged. That will underexpose full daylight. You can then overpower the sun with a small flash and shoot wide open in the process for gorgeous backgrounds at f/2<br/>
<a href="http://strobist.blogspot.co.il/2013/05/leaf-shutter-nd-flash-fuji-x100s.html">strobist.blogspot.co.il/2013/05/leaf-shutter-nd-flash-fuj&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> lose the slip-on lens cap and get a hood and a 49mm skylight filter. And not a crap filter, either, as the aspherical 23mm/2 (35mm/2 equiv.) lens deserves good glass in front. Put the lens cap in a drawer and go filter/hood full-time.<br/>
<a href="http://strobist.blogspot.fr/2013/03/in-depth-new-fujifilm-x100s.html">strobist.blogspot.fr/2013/03/in-depth-new-fujifilm-x100s&#8230;.</a></p>

<p><strong>4. </strong>I normally configure my custom settings for +1 Color Boost and +1 Sharpness.</p>

<p>Function Button – You can assign a variety of functions to the function button (FN) for quick access. Things like ISO, ND Filter, Film Simulation etc. During the day, I set mine to turn off/on the ND filter. At night, or if I’m in a situation where I need ISO control, I’ll set it to ISO.<br/>
<a href="http://www.hossedia.com/reviews/fuji-x100s-review/">www.hossedia.com/reviews/fuji-x100s-review/</a></p>

<p><strong>5. </strong>Great review and reason why x100s that convinced me<br/>
<a href="http://www.mitchellkphotos.com/blog/2013/10/15/istanbul-and-my-review-of-fuji-x100s/">www.mitchellkphotos.com/blog/2013/10/15/istanbul-and-my-r&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>6. </strong>Fujix x100s collection of all materials found in the net <br/>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wosimsphotography/fuji-x100s-testberichte-reviews">sites.google.com/site/wosimsphotography/fuji-x100s-testbe&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>7. </strong>If you use mostly the opti­cal finder, turn the “OVF power save mode” on. The display’s info will be dimmed a bit, and the live his­togram is no longer avail­able, but it will greatly extend the bat­tery life. I strongly rec­om­mend read­ing pages 18, 36, 41, 47, and 91 from the Camera’s Instruc­tion Man­ual.<br/>
<a href="http://www.eduardoangel.com/2013/11/12/fuji-x100s-hands-on-review/">www.eduardoangel.com/2013/11/12/fuji-x100s-hands-on-review/</a></p>

<p><strong>8. </strong>B&amp;W shooting tips:<br/>
My favorite B&amp;W setting on the X100S for most situations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Film simulation: B-R (B&amp;W Red Filter)</li>
<li>Sharpness: +1</li>
<li>Highlight Tone: 0</li>
<li>Shadow Tone: +1</li>
<li>Noise Reduction: -2</li>
</ul>


<p>And in case you don&#8217;t have a lot of experience with B&amp;W photography the Fuji X cameras with EVF or LCD will take you by the hand and guide you to your first successful exposures. When you switch your JPG to B&amp;W you will see a B&amp;W image in the EVF / LCD preview. Now use the exposure compensation dial (in Aperture priority mode) to increase or decrease the exposure and get a more predominant black or white look.</p>

<p>Still not sure if you want to deprive your exposures of the color for good? No problem! Set the Fuji X100S to shoot JPG + RAW and the RAW file will contain all of the color information just in case you change your mind later. The EVF will still show the B&amp;W preview.</p>

<p>So, are you ready to give it a try? Then why not just save the B&amp;W settings as one of your custom settings in your X100S for those occasions when you feel like shooting Monochrome :)<br/>
<a href="http://fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2013/10/the-Fuji-X100S-made-me-a-better-BW-photographer.html">fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2013/10/the-Fuji-X100S-made-me-&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>9. </strong>If maximum operating speed is important to you, then switch off all energy saving- and switch on all performance improving features. What also helps is when you use the fastest UHS-I SDHC cards. But with all energy saving turned off, I highly recommend that you buy at least one, or better yet, two spare batteries for your X100S.</p>

<p>The lens picks up some flare and this is identical to the lens on the original X100. Hence, I would buy the lens hood with adapter for two reasons:<br/>
A. To control flare.<br/>
B. To have a filter thread for the use of filter or simply to plug in a standard lens cap (49mm filter and lens cap for the adapter without the lens hood and a 52mm lens cap for use with the lens hood attached - you can see this on the second photo from the top). And do get the lens caps with the pinch release in the middle of the cap!</p>

<p>The X100S has turned into my every day take along camera. It is my street, portrait and city/landscape tool. And, I use it 95% of the time as a B&amp;W camera! I set the camera to record JPG + RAW and set the JPG to be captured in BW + Red Filter. This way the EVF and the review image in the EVF &amp; OVF will show a B&amp;W image which is closest to the way I would process it. The RAW file still contains the color information and will be rendered as a color image in my LightRoom collection, next to the B&amp;W JPG image.</p>

<p>I find that seeing a scene in B&amp;W is less distracting and lets me focus more intensely on the subject and situation of the scene.</p>

<p>These are my preferred every day settings when I&#8217;m out with the X100S:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fn = ND Filter (heavily used in bright conditions to overcome the f2 &amp; 1/1000s limit)</li>
<li>RAW + JPG</li>
<li>ISO: Auto 6400 at 1/100s (I&#8217;d rather take a bit more noise than motion blur)</li>
<li>Film simulation: B-R (B&amp;W Red Filter)</li>
<li>Sharpness: +1</li>
<li>Highlight Tone: 0</li>
<li>Shadow Tone: +1</li>
<li>Noise Reduction: -2</li>
<li>MF Assist: Max</li>
<li>High Performance Mode: On</li>
<li>Power Saving: Off</li>
<li>Review Time: 0.5 S</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>10. </strong>Focusing tips relevant for x100s as well <br/>
<a href="http://www.fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2012/08/fuji-x-pro-1-af-autofocus-speed-and.html">www.fujixfiles.blogspot.co.il/2012/08/fuji-x-pro-1-af-aut&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>11.</strong> Optical viewfinder prallax explained in details <br/>
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2011/07/ps-to-the-fuji-x100-review-parallax.html">theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong>12. </strong> When you are shooting objects that quickly move towards the camera, better use the famous “Autofocus Trick”, also known as “shutter mash technique”: Set the camera to AF-S or AF-C (use AF-S if you want to assign a particular AF field, use AF-C if you are okay with the center spot or area) and press the shutter all the way through in one quick, swift motion (no half-pressing!) while keeping the AF field trained over the area of your subject that you want to be in focus. Since the X100S operates with Autofocus Priority, it won’t take the shot until it has actually locked focus (or until it gave up, in which case the shot will probably be wasted).</p>

<p>Shortcuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press and hold the Q button for a few seconds to clearly increase the brightness of the LCD. This can be quite helpful when operating the camera in bright light, like on a sunny day.</li>
<li>Press and hold the MENU/OK button down to lock or unlock the arrow keys and the Q button.</li>
<li>A long press of the Fn button will bring up the Fn button’s configuration menu, where you can assign one of several functions. I typically assign ISO to this button, because I like to be able to quickly change my Auto-ISO configuration (minimum shutter speed). Another popular option for this button is enabling the camera’s built-in ND filter.</li>
<li>Press and hold DISP/BACK button to activate (or deactivate) the camera’s Silent Mode. When this mode is turned on, the X100S functions quietly and inconspicuously. It won’t make any artificial noises and it abstains from using both the flash and the AF-assist lamp.</li>
<li>Pressing the DISP/BACK button while selecting an AF field in AF-S Area mode will immediately select the central AF field.</li>
<li>Press DISP/BACK in shooting or playback mode to change the view of the currently active display. This means that in order to change the view of either the OVF, the EVF or the LCD, either the OVF, EVF or LCD must be active when you press the button. You can select the display you want to change with the VIEW MODE button. Alternatively, use the eye-sensor to activate a display by looking through it, then change its view with the DISP/BACK button. The X100S can’t read your mind, you need to tell it which display’s view you want to change.</li>
<li>Finally, to check (or upgrade) the firmware version of the camera, press and hold the DISP/BACK button while switching on the camera.</li>
<li>In manual focus mode, press the AE-L/AF-L button to initiate an autofocus run.</li>
<li>Also in manual focus mode, press and hold the command dial to cycle through the camera’s different MF aids: standard, digital split image and focus peaking.</li>
<li>Press (but do not hold) the command dial to enlarge the current image to inspect its sharpness. This works in both MF and AF modes.</li>
<li>Rather than selecting a function in the shooting menu by pressing the OK button, you can press the shutter button halfway down. Pressing the shutter button halfway down while in playback mode switches the camera directly into shooting mode. You can wake the camera by pressing the shutter button halfway down as well.</li>
<li>Double-tap the macro button to switch between normal and macro modes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14.</strong> JJC hood and B+W Pro filter: Protection. spend a few dollars, put these on and keep them there. I don&#8217;t use a cap on this camera (they come off and I lose them). But don&#8217;t use a cheap filter. B + W are the best. German made, pure optics. Whats the point of having a camera with the best sensor and glass, if you stick cheap distorted junk in front of it. $50 won&#8217;t break the bank! The hood stops glare and adds more protection. You can spend $$ for the fuji one, or $ for a nasty el cheapo. Spend $ and get the JJC. as good as the real thing, but not flimsy.</p>

<p><strong>More Updates:</strong></p>

<p><strong>15.</strong> Auto-ISO settings discussion - I&#8217;m finding ISO 6400 is just fine, in fact amazing on this camera so I &#8216;ve set my minimum speed at 1/125.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fujixspot.com/showthread.php?t=853">http://www.fujixspot.com/showthread.php?t=853</a></p>

<p><strong>16.</strong> In video shooting if you are stuggling with automatic focus, set aperture and shutter to Automatic mode and choose AF-C mode to get constant continues focus.</p>

<p><strong>17.</strong> Unless you are doing macro work with f2 then it works perfectly fine in most cases. The focal length of this lens gives you a larger depth of field anyway. Anything farther away than about 5 feet and at any aperture above 2.8 should be just fine for focus and recompose.</p>

<p>Hope you liked it.<br/>
If you have more tips &amp; tricks to add to the list, please leave in comments.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not much, but considering our current size and cultural gaps we had, I&#8217;m very satisfied!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it took me a while to get back to life after a huge jet lag hit me badly. Surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t that hard when I went from here to San Francisco, but it was much harder to come back to Israel. 10 hour difference in time zones do the thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back from 10 days business and pleasure trip to Bay Area - San Francisco, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Paulo Alto, Cupertino, Saratoga (AKA Silicon Valley), San Jose and Santa Cruz. Here is a classic postcard picture I took in San Francisco:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7294/9138679173_f71502b827_b.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge © David Virtser" /></p>

<p>We spent 2 days in San Francisco just traveling for pleasure,  followed by 4 intensive days of <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/">Velocity</a> and <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-mountainview/">DevOpsDays</a> conferences in Santa Clara. The former is expensive, very big, public, focused on Web Performance and Operations. The latter is small, private, focused of DevOps culture.</p>

<p>The conferences were different, but both very good. The reason I go there was to learn more about DevOps culture from experience of real companies and people who do it in modern web industry. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Netflix and others.</p>

<p>Few insights that I marked to myself and were repeated over and over again on number of different sessions which are important for a company to be Agile/Lean:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Make a focus</strong> - Great companies do one product, but do it outstanding. They focus on their product whole holistic experience - how it looks, how it feels, how responsive is it, how reliable is it, how easy is it, how intuitive is it, how much time does it take to get an answer from customer support and etc… They invest most of the time in robust and scalable infrastructure, in performance of the applications, in fixing bugs, optimizing and analyzing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recruit professionals</strong> - experienced, full-stack developers are expensive, but in long run they worth it. You can have a lot of developers with potential, but still they need a senior to show them the right path and explain how things work in real world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging &amp; Monitoring</strong> - more than half of the booths and sessions in conferences where about monitoring and measuring of applications in production. It&#8217;s extremely important to invest in this area. The tools that where mentioned the most: <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a>, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, <a href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a>/<a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open source everything</strong> - open sourcing your code is coming with great responsibility to support the community (pull request, issues), but it also teaches you how to write good application -  tests, documentation, generic code, etc.. If you do it right, you will get help back from community. Open sourcing is social  programming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bootcamps</strong> - workshops, lectures. It&#8217;s a common practice. Do it more to train your people and get them involved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft</strong> - Windows, .NET world is a dead end. It&#8217;s hardly  scalable (MS SQL Server), slower (IIS), harder to operate, complicated automation, requires stronger hardware and more.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We are definitely going to work on all of these in eToro.</p>

<p>Few videos from the conferences which I liked and inspired me the most:</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2435220/video/69079272">Leading the Horses to Drink &#8230; Support and Initiate a devops transformation</a></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2435220/video/69078828">Devops+Agile = Business Transformation</a></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2435220/video/69079946">Continuous Quality</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGFGdFS_3Cc&amp;list=SP055Epbe6d5bdB4KPqssegVpYUDJXSzOp&amp;index=16">f You Don&#8217;t Understand People, You Don&#8217;t Understand Ops</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZT_Q3z520&amp;list=SP055Epbe6d5bdB4KPqssegVpYUDJXSzOp&amp;index=12">Gamedays on the Obama Campaign</a></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for today. See you at <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-telaviv/">DevOpsDays Tel-Aviv</a>. eToro is going to sponsor this event and hopefully we will be able to present our journey there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes in eToro we are doing really innovative and beautiful things.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://openbook.etoro.com">Openbook</a> web application most of the calls are executed on client side using Ajax. Which means that our pages content is  changing dynamically. Google bots can index static content pages only.</p>

<p>It was a challenge to find a good and easy to implement solution which required minimum of changes on <a href="https://openbook.etoro.com">Openbook</a> itslef.</p>

<p>Find below the presentation explaining our solution:</p>
